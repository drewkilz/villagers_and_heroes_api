Villagers and Heroes API
========================

Code related to the game Villagers &amp; Heroes

Flask
-----
- Shell
    - Run a flask shell to load the flask application and be able to utilize the objects for debugging, testing, etc.
    
            $ flask shell

Tesseract
---------
Tesseract is an open source text recognition (OCR) engine used for parsing screenshots from the game for the village
tools.

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdoc/blob/master/Home.md

See /tesseract for details on how I trained tesseract to recognize the V&H font for improved accuracy.

Digital Ocean (Deployment)
--------------------------
The API is currently deployed on Digital Ocean.

Original deployment was done via:
    
    # SSH into the droplet on Digital Ocean
    ssh -i /Users/drewkilz/.ssh/id_rsa_do root@159.65.108.26
    
    # Add a user to run the applications
    adduser vnh
    
    # Make the user a superuser
    usermod -aG sudo vnh
    
    # Allow OpenSSH through the Firewall
    ufw allow OpenSSH
    ufw enable
    
    # Switch to the vnh user
    su vnh
    
    # install nginx and python - had to do one at a time as there were errors when trying to install all at once
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nginx
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    sudo apt install python3-dev
    sudo apt install build-essential

    sudo apt install libffi-dev
    sudo apt install python3-setuptools
    sudo apt install python3-venv
    sudo apt install libsm6 libxext6 libxrender-dev
    sudo apt autoremove
    
    # Enable HTTPS and HTTPS traffic
    sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
    
    # Change to home directory
    cd ~

    # git clone our repo
    git clone https://github.com/drewkilz/villagers_and_heroes_api.git
    
    # Create a virtual environment and activate it
    python3.6 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # Install requirements
    pip install wheel
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    # Create the database
    ./create_database.sh
    
    # Create automatic startup of the API
    sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/villagers_and_heroes_api.service

Useful commands on the server:
    
    # Log files
    sudo less /var/log/nginx/error.log: checks the Nginx error logs.
    sudo less /var/log/nginx/access.log: checks the Nginx access logs.
    sudo journalctl -f -u nginx: checks the Nginx process logs.
    sudo journalctl -f -u villagers_and_heroes_api: checks your Flask appâ€™s Gunicorn logs.
    
    # Reboot the machine
    sudo reboot
    
    # systemd commands
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart villagers_and_heroes_api

    # nginx commands
    sudo systemctl stop nginx
    sudo systemctl start nginx
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    sudo systemctl reload nginx  # Reloads without dropping connections - useful for configuration changes, for example
    sudo systemctl disable nginx  # To disable automatic startup when server boots
    sudo systemctl enable nginx  # Re-enable automatic startup
    
    # nginx files
    /var/www/html: The actual web content, which by default only consists of the default Nginx page you saw earlier, is served out of the /var/www/html directory. This can be changed by altering Nginx configuration files.
    /etc/nginx: The Nginx configuration directory. All of the Nginx configuration files reside here.
    /etc/nginx/nginx.conf: The main Nginx configuration file. This can be modified to make changes to the Nginx global configuration.
    /etc/nginx/sites-available/: The directory where per-site server blocks can be stored. Nginx will not use the configuration files found in this directory unless they are linked to the sites-enabled directory. Typically, all server block configuration is done in this directory, and then enabled by linking to the other directory.
    /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/: The directory where enabled per-site server blocks are stored. Typically, these are created by linking to configuration files found in the sites-available directory.
    /etc/nginx/snippets: This directory contains configuration fragments that can be included elsewhere in the Nginx configuration. Potentially repeatable configuration segments are good candidates for refactoring into snippets.
    /var/log/nginx/access.log: Every request to your web server is recorded in this log file unless Nginx is configured to do otherwise.
    /var/log/nginx/error.log: Any Nginx errors will be recorded in this log.

    # Certificate information
    - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
    /etc/letsencrypt/live/vnh.thespottedlynx.com/fullchain.pem
    
    Your key file has been saved at:
    /etc/letsencrypt/live/vnh.thespottedlynx.com/privkey.pem
    
    Your cert will expire on 2020-10-19. To obtain a new or tweaked
    version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
    with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
    your certificates, run "certbot renew"
    
    # Delete a certificate
    $ sudo certbot delete
