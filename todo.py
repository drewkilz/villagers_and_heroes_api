# TODO: react.js to actually do something!!
# TODO: Pagination on the recipes page
# TODO: Implement user registration and login as it will be needed for village maintenance
# TODO: Implement village tool - import screenshots (roster or village project), parse, then store and allow display
#  over time of contributions, etc. - for this one, may need a new backend database, so split out into a separate api
#  application, maybe
# TODO: Implement crafting party tool - list out all the enhancements to crafting speed to allow checking, then
#  calculate the number of resources needed per 20 minute crafting buff
